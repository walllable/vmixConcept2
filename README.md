# vmixConcept2
 An example VMix project file, mainly built around loops. This might be used in Instagib someday, I dunno.  
 FL Studio Project File requires FL Studio 20.8 [build 2115] or newer. To open it, don't unzip it, just open the .zip file with FL Studio.  
 BPM: 120.1  
 This features:
 * A looping TB-303 bassline, who's loop was exported with no effects, so that effects (such as distortion, delay and reverb) could be added here instead.
    * Has a high and low octave, whose volume can be controlled separately (pre-distortion of course)
    * Has two cutoff states which can be crossfaded between
    * Has adjustable distortion/drive
 * Looping kickdrum and snare
    * Can be crossfaded between just the kickdrum, and kickdrum + snare (They aren't separate, sorry!)
 * Looping hi-hats
    * I actually recorded these hihats myself!
    * Can be crossfaded between closed and open
